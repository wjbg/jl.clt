# jl.CLT - Classical Lamination Theory in Julia

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A collection of Julia functions for the Classical Lamination Theory
(CLT). The functions are part of a Master course on Composites at the
University of Twente. Check out [m.CLT](https://github.com/wjbg/m.CLT)
for a Matlab or [py.CLT](https://github.com/wjbg/py.CLT) for a Python
implementation.

For background information on the CLT, the reader is kindly invited to
join the course :smirk:. If that is not an option, the following
sources are highly recommended:
* [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-11-mechanics-of-materials-fall-1999/modules/MIT3_11F99_laminates.pdf)
shared a short summary of the Classical Lamination Theory.
* [TU
  Delft](https://ocw.tudelft.nl/course-lectures/classical-laminate-theory-clt/)
  provides an open course on the topic.
* [efunda](https://www.efunda.com/formulae/solid_mechanics/composites/comp_laminate.cfm) has an online calculator with a bit of background information.

## Usage
